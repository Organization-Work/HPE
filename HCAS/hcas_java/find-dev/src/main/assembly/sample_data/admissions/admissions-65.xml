FINDINGS: The patient is s/p left frontotemporal craniotomy, and there is cystic- appearing encephalomalacia in the left temporoparietal region in the region of the surgical bed. Continues with pulmonary toliet. Neuro: Pt sedated, presently on propofol 100cmg/kg/min and fentanyl 100mcg/hr. T WAVES SEEMED SL MORE ELEVATED @ 2400. Very supportive. Questionable corneals, impaired cough and no gag. Moderate, fixed anterior wall defect. The right brachial vein was then accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. no bm. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the brain prior to and following the administration of gadolinium (15 mL of magnevist). Note is made of stable appearance of the lesion since surgery on serial scans. Cooperative with care. There is atelectasis within the basal portion of the left lower lobe which causes obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. See flowsheet for further data. Nursing addendum Hct up to 39.

      <TEXT>Neuro: Pt A&amp;OX3, C/O RLQ pain at incision line during movement. At the OSH, he was given 2 units of FFP, 10mg of vitamin K, and was loaded with 1g of fosphenytoin. PERL. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. IMPRESSION: Status post catheter device placement within the left parietal cystic structure. GU: foley draining adequate clear yellow urine-faintly pink at times. Neb treatments q6hrs. -motor: Normal bulk throughout. CVP 10-12, Extremities warm with palpable periferal pulses. He denies any history of bleeding, any history of jaundice (his family endorses this). OMR note of several episodes of rest pain of unclear etiology (? vasospasm) post cath and prior to d/c on last admit. TFs changed to full stregnth and rate now advanced to 40cc/h, low residuals. IMPRESSION: Decreased pulmonary edema. FAIRLY SEDATED ON FENTANYL GTT 50 MCG WITH INTERMITTANT BOLUSES. Neuro: Alert and oriented x 3, MAE. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>No history of illicit drug use. PTT to be rechecked 1230am. Seen by cardiology who recommended no further treatment unless patient symptomatic or having other signs of poor perfusion (poor urine output). STARTED ON 12,5 MG PO BID WHICH WAS INCREASED TO 50MG PO Q8HRS THIS PM(GIVEN AT 5:30PM.) LASIX GIVEN AND GOOD U/O RESPONSE. HO AWARE OF THE ABOVE AND WILL INFORM WITH ANY CHANGES. Retroperitoneal fluid as described above. BS's clear in upper lobes and decreased at bases. Discharge Disposition: Home Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Post tonsillectomy bleed 2) Metastatic tonsil cancer  Cardio: BP stable 100-120/60-70's. He remained hemodynamically stable. Continues on Levaquin for CA PNA. CV- Hypertensive in am and labetolol gtt restarted. Further followup studies recommended. COPD: nightly home 02. Note is made of stable appearance of the lesion since surgery on serial scans. CVP 8. Medicated with tylenol with fair relief at times.

Cont on fentanyl gtt at 150mcg/hr with minimal effect. It is unclear whether this large fluid collection actually communicates with retroperitoneal fluid described above. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. +1 general edema on LUE &amp; LLE, small amount of serous drainage noted from LUE; ionized Ca 1.34  Disp:*240 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 3. No evidence of acute arterial thrombotic/occlusion that would threaten this limb acutely. Periventricular white matter hypodensity is present and is notably greater on the left than the right, likely representing persistent peritumoral edema. Setting of psv14/peep5 and 30%. Given the findings of his stress test, CT surgery was consulted. No prior MRIs are available at this institution. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: picc line placement. O2 sats 97-100%. There are no large pleural effusions. MAE, right upper and lower extremities stronger than left side. </TEXT>
