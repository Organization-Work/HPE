      <TEXT>FINAL REPORT CLINICAL INDICATION: Increased oxygen requirement in patient with coronary artery disease and CHF. PO2 80'S C-PAP TO 7.5. C-collar intact, c-spine precautions maintained. This was complicated by a rectus sheath hematoma. Please assess Admitting Diagnosis: CONTROL OF TONSILAR BLEED  UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: 53 year old man intubated at outside hospital. We were unable to actually close his calvarium due to the massive amount of cerebral edema, therefore he did receive a craniectomy and had skin closure over his brain parenchyma. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are seen. Nodular hepatic contour is consistent with underlying cirrhosis. SOCIAL: NO VISITORS OR PHONE INQUIRIES. </TEXT>
