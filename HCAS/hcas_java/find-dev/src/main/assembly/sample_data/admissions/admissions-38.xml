PLAN: MASK VENTILATION, WEAN O2, MONITOR PCO2 LEVELS, PULMONARY HYGIENE, PHYSICAL THERAPY. Abd soft distended, hypoactive BS. Family all feel this is want pt would want. Toleratng soft foods better (jello, applesause, etc.). The right brachial vein was then accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. Urine cx grew ampicillin sensitive enterococcus. Upset by patient decline. Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 2. The LAD was unable to be stented. Glucoses less then 120 no insulin, 121 to 160 2 units, 161 to 200 4 units, 201 to 240 6 units, 241 to 280 8 units, 281 to 320 10 units, 321 to 360 12 units, 361 to 400 14 units, greater then 400 16 units. There is atelectasis within the basal portion of the left lower lobe which causes obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.

      <TEXT>Pulmonary was consulted, because of the CT and chest x-ray showing dependent consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions and large ascus vein. HRLY U/O&gt;35CC. Pt remains pain free. Pelvic loops of bowel are displaced posteriorly and superior by this large fluid collection. There are some subtle areas of increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, which could be due to small vessel disease or post therapy. Pt taken to OR that day and had an I%D of left groin Vac dsg applied. There is also dependent atelectasis running along the major fissures bilaterally and in the lung adjacent to the effusions. 500cc LR given with effect. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with the tip terminating in the SVC. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and were essential for diagnosis. A central catheter is present, terminating in the superior vena cava. He will follow midline (close your eyes, open your mouth), but not appendicular commands. </TEXT>
