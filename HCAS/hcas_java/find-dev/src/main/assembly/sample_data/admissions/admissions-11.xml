      <TEXT>As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. Coronal reformations were also obtained and reviewed. therefore, patency of the distal dorsalis pedis artery within the foot cannot be assessed. RR reg/unlabored. Abd is soft, NT, ND, Obese. PB's for DVT prophylaxis. Please assess ETT placement. Cont on fentanyl gtt at 150mcg/hr with minimal effect. HOSPITAL COURSE: The Liver Service was consulted, because the patient has undergone a liver transplant six years ago for alcohol induced cirrhosis.
