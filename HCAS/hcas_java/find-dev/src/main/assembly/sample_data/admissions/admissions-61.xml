      <TEXT>HO AWARE OF THE ABOVE AND WILL INFORM WITH ANY CHANGES. The right hepatic artery is patent with normal waveforms. IV therapy failed. NO BM. Toleratng soft foods better (jello, applesause, etc.). Gi/GU Foley to gravity Q.S. Hourly UOP. Pt awake at 0930, crushed plavix and mixed w/ custard. Chest examination showed poor air movement bilaterally, but equal. No studies available for comparison. Right groin site intact. The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. since waking has required transient ntg to maintain sbp &lt; 140 w hr ranging from 100-110 w stimulation.
