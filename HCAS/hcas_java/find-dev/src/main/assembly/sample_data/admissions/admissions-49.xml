FINDINGS: Lung excursion has improved and no focal consolidation is evident. His last drink was five days prior to admission. Call out to floor 2. Bilateral consolidations are noted, predominantly in the superior aspect of the right lower lobe where multiple air bronchograms are seen. Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization with a angioplasty with stent placement to the left anterior descending coronary artery at the mid and distal portion. He became asystolic at 9:55, and remained asystolic for a total of five minutes confirming the criteria that were met for proceeding with a donation after cardiac death. No prior MRIs are available at this institution. Cont. to monitor resp status, place on NIV as indicated.
