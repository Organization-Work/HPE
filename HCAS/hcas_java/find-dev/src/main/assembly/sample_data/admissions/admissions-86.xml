      <TEXT>There is again evidence of slight left ventricular enlargement of the heart. The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable. Now only making very minimal paraphasic errors and having only minimal cognitive problems. NGT should be advanced so that side ports are all below the diaphragm. There was no obvious weakness or other concerning symptoms. CV: HR 90's SR; episode x1 with HR up to 160, SBP down to 99, ? SVT- SICU HO present; subsided to rate in low 100's without intervention; labetolol gtt initiated with effect. There is evidence of improved prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggesting improved heart failure. Pt also given alb neb and suct for thick creamy sput. Pt on Bipap. Imaging Protocol: gated SPECT. 1500 PT. Ph has improved from 7.21 to 7.28. admitted to ccu for observation. MOVING ALL EXTREMITIES, NO NEURO DEFICITS NOTED @ THIS TIME. MAPs generally &gt;60.
