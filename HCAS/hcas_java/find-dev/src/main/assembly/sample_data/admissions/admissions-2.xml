Popliteal artery is occluded, however, there is reconstitution of the anterior tibial artery via lateral collaterals. PT DIURESING ~ 50CC/HRLY, PT ~ +50OCC SINCE MN. There has been interval placement of a right-sided IJ central venous line with its distal tip located within the upper right atrium. This contains a few air bronchograms. FINDINGS: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable. Several low attenuation areas in the kidneys are too small to fully characterize. Some associated upper zone redistribution is present but this is difficult to evaluate since the patient is supine.
