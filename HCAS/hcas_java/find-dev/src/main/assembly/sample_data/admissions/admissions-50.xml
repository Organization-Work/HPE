      <TEXT>? doboff placement today? + bowel sounds. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1. Open lung biopsy was a lung transplant. When this was done is not documented. more difficult to arouse placed back on cpap.  FINAL REPORT PICC LINE PLACEMENT INDICATION: Left temporal astrocytoma, hemorrhage, bradycardia, need for IV therapy, failed bedside attempt. There are some subtle areas of increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, which could be due to small vessel disease or post therapy. CT of the abdomen was obtained, which showed a large intraperitoneal hematoma of unclear source with rectus abdominal muscle involvement. No hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. see respiratory page of carevu for more information.
