      <TEXT>GI: NGT to CLWS draining mod amounts of coffee ground material. Protonix 40 mg po q day, methadone 100 m q.d.,  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without IV or oral contrast. We arec sxtn for scant to minimal secrettions fro ETT. TO 91-91% WHILE SLEEPING NC REAAPLIED. There is no abnormal signal deep to the region of enhancement. IMPRESSION: Large fluid collection in the space of Retzius, with fluid-fluid level is indicative of a hematoma. A 0.018 guide wire was then advanced through the needle and into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. no residuals. Radiographic findings do not explain hypoxia. No diagnostic abnormalities. Pt was on Plavix and Heparin for EF of 30%. The previously described left lower lobe opacity has improved and nearly resolved. Pt then transfered to CSRU for BiPAP and monitoring. Questions answered/support provided. Right nasolabial fold flattened. A/P- pt neurologically unchanged, family mtg today. MICU Progress Note for day shift: Neuro: AAOx3, periods of forgetfulness, but this is his baseline. Continue nutrition/ advance feeds by 10ml every 6 hours to goal 80ml. </TEXT>

Periventricular white matter hypodensity is present and is notably greater on the left than the right, likely representing persistent peritumoral edema. He has also been progressively lethargic and decreased energy per transfer note. Plan: monitor bood sugars, orient as needed, keep sitter at bedside, ? increase in lopressor dose, ? f2 later today if pt remains stable. WILL ATTEMPT WEAN AGAIN THIS AM.
