      <TEXT>more difficult to arouse placed back on cpap. ABD/SOFT OBESE. -BS. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. Extention of extremities to noxious stimuli such as nipple pinch yet minimal response. Team aware. After the inner cannula was removed, the PICC was then advanced over the wire through the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. Plan to complete organ donor protocals and extubated around 2100. Respiratory Care Pt continues on CPAP/PSV 10/5 as documented. </TEXT>
