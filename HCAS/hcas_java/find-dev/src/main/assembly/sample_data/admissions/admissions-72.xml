      <TEXT>PLAN: CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR RESP STATUS. Nodular hepatic contour is consistent with underlying cirrhosis. AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval extubation. No gross abnormalities are seen in the visualized portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, and left kidney. There has been interval development of collapse of the left upper lobe. Collapse of left upper lobe as well as patchy atelectasis in left lower lobe, which may be due to the malpositioned tube. Review of system: Code status is now DNR Neuro: AAOx3, difficult at times w/ coming up w/ some words. Local anesthesia was achieved with subcutaneous injection of 2 cc of 1% lidocaine. poor appetite, taking small amts from meals. There were no immediate post-procedure complications. FINDINGS: There are no aneurysms. PT TOLERATING CLEAR LIQUIDS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY. He was transfused for a hematocrit of 22. The peel-away sheath and wire were then removed. transfered from ED after med flighted from OSH ED d/t sudden onset of expressive aphasia. </TEXT>

GU: foley draining adequate clear yellow urine-faintly pink at times. 02 on R/A 80-82%. Feeds are via ogt. PELVIS CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: Fluid collection (16.6 x 9.7 cm) in the space of Retzius of the anterior pelvis contains a fluid-fluid level and possibly arises from the right rectus abdominis muscle. No surrounding hemorrhage or mass effect. He denies dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation. Susceptibility artifact is identified within the medial aspect of the left knee, presumably from a prior graft, however, no graft flow is identified, and thus it is presumably occluded. RESP: ls clear with dim bases. There is some ill-defined loss of translucency in the right mid- and lower zones and atelectatic changes are demonstrated in the left lower lobe behind the heart. </TEXT>
