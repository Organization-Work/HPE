IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is a relatively mild region of right infrahilar consolidation which could be atelectasis. Bair hugger on. RESP: CPT X1. PLAN: MONITOR NEURO, MONITOR CIRCULATION, WEAN MECHANICAL VENTILATION, PULMONARY HYGIENE, CHANGE WOUND DRESSING. PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. Collapse of left upper lobe as well as patchy atelectasis in left lower lobe, which may be due to the malpositioned tube. Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. The urinary bladder is collapsed around the balloon of a Foley catheter. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>given haldol 2 mgs at 12md and has been less picky and less paranoid since then. Pt. dropped bp to 70-80's this am w/ audible wheezing. nonproductive cough. Will cont to follow as needed. BP AROUND 100 SYSTOLIC. Does not note a buldge in her inguinum, nor necorosis. After CT done and pt moved to bed from CT table, pt again c/o CP which again resolved on its own. IMPRESSION: Stereotactic frame placement for biopsy of left parietal cystic structure with enhancing nodular rim. Please assess ETT placement. Monitor resp. status. GU: DECREASED UO RECIEVED 10 MG IVP LASIX WITH GOOD RESPONSE. There were no immediate post-procedure complications. There is a slight decrease in laryngeal elevation and delayed closure of the vestibule. Periventricular white matter hypodensity is present and is notably greater on the left than the right, likely representing persistent peritumoral edema. A catheter device has been introduced and there is a moderate amount of air within the collection. Pt became hypotensive w/ BP 83. At the time of discharge the patient was in stable condition. Plan: Monitor hemodynamics. </TEXT>
