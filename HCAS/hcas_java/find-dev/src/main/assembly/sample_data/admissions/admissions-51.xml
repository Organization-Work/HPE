Bleeding site identified in right tonsillar fossa that was status post unilateral extended tonsillectomy. FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a catheter into the left cystic structure in the resection bed (patient with history of anaplastic astrocytoma status post resection). PLAN: MASK VENTILATION, WEAN O2, MONITOR PCO2 LEVELS, PULMONARY HYGIENE, PHYSICAL THERAPY. INR 1.4. Oriented x3. PULSES WEAKLY PALPABLE AND DOPPLERABLE. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, allowing for differences in projection. BUN, CR elevated. Sats 99-100%. There is magnetic susceptibility from the blood products as well as the clips in the craniotomy site, which obscures some of the image. No c/o pain. Lopressor changed to IV, additional 2. A large amount of perihepatic ascites is identified. TITRATING TO MAINTAIN SBP&gt;110. </TEXT>

CT DRAINAGE MINIMAL UNTIL CPT AND TURNING WITH A 170ML DUMP. Plan: To extubate this am. Mannitol and dilantin continued. A slow ooze was visualized from the right tonsillar fossa which was cauterized. Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. He was discharged home on POD3 without further event. Low O2 saturation. Skin intact x surgical incisions. PTCA and stent x4 to LAD, (80% mRCA not intervened at this time) c/b dissection in distal LAD. ID: TMAX 100. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pt also just finished blood transfusion. Lungs are clear/coarse diminished in bases. </TEXT>
