CONDITION UPDATED POST-OP DAY #1 CAUTERIZATION FOR TONSILLER BLEED PLEASE REFER TO CAREVU FOR DETAIL INFO;  Has been evaluated by her surgeon who plans to operate following cardiovascular work up. OOB to chair BID. All other meds held at present time d/t lethargy. A final chest radiograph confirmed placement of the tip of the catheter to be in the superior vena cava. No hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. SATS 94-95% ON RA. 150CC'S OUT THIS AM. Assessment for hepatic mass is limited. The patient was then observed intubated overnight in the surgical ICU. Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to determine whether the amount of peripheral enhancement has increased. The patient continued to show clinical improvement and on postoperative day six was transferred to the regular nursing floor. The patient's family consented. The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. </TEXT>
