The anterior tibial artery continues within the leg, but occludes at the level of the ankle. FINDINGS: Again seen is a rim enhancing fluid collection in the left parietal lobe with an enhancing peripheral nodule. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. bp 103/54-160/50 . There are patchy opacities in the left upper and left lower lung zones consistent with atelectasis or consolidation. IMPRESSION: 1. Layering right pleural effusions. IMPRESSION: Improving pulmonary edema. Slight left sided facial droop, neuro consulted pt today. Bedrest. CV: tmax 99.1, Hr 66-90, BP 130-160/69-79,  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar angiographic sequences of the abdominal aorta and lower extremities were obtained. Occasional strong cough.
