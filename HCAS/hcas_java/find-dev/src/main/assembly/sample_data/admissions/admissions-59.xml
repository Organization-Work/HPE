FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited secondary to patient body habitus. Pt intubated and CTscan showed frontal-parietal bleed and SDH with midline shift and numerous facial, sinus and skull fxs.

He did have a nuclear scintigraphy scan confirming that he had some normal perfusion to his right brain, however, vastly diminished perfusion to his left brain. PELVIS CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: Fluid collection (16.6 x 9.7 cm) in the space of Retzius of the anterior pelvis contains a fluid-fluid level and possibly arises from the right rectus abdominis muscle. Currently full code. There are no pleural effusions. Given a total of 2. No evidence of acute arterial thrombotic/occlusion that would threaten this limb acutely. Discussed with housestaff. </TEXT>
