VS STABLE, EXTUBATED AND FEELING MUCH BETTER THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING, STRIDOR OR SOB. most tender along hallux, no point tenderness at dorsum. An enhancing nodule is seen at the medial periphery of the lesion, and there is slight nodularity to the enhancing rim, both findings suggestive of tumor recurrence. given lasix 120mg slow IVP pre transfusion. mannitol as ordered-&gt; osmos less than 320. reported to MD.

Continue to follow and begin NPH o  The nuclear scan showed moderate reversible defect of the inferior wall severe partial reversible defect of the apex and a fixed moderate defect of the anterior wall with global hypokinesis. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the brain with multiplanar post-gadolinium T1 imaging. NG tube tip projects below the diaphragm, but one of the side holes is above the diaphragm and should be advanced several centimeters. 1300 ABG: 7.31,51,106,27,-1,97,97% ON 2LNC.
