SLIGHT C/O SORE THROAT. MSO4 given at 2100 and 2140 5mg each dose. Patient opens eyes to stim, localizes pain. The patient was placed on a perioperative Cortisone stress doses. Resp: 02 sat continues to be at 85-91% on 6l n/p and 100% face tent. Tylenol given for general aches. HOSPITAL COURSE: The Liver Service was consulted, because the patient has undergone a liver transplant six years ago for alcohol induced cirrhosis. There are moderate pleural effusions bilaterally, right greater than left. Patient was transported to OSH where he was intubated for airway protection and his oropharynx and nose was packed. </TEXT>
