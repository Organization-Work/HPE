Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. WIFE AND DAUGHTER WENT HOME FOR A WHILE,WILL BE BACK THIS EVEN. Left parietal white matter edema/infiltrative neoplasm is unchanged. pm continue with pulmonary toilet follow up on ct scan results. CV: Rate SB 40s-50s but this is baseline, per wife.

      <TEXT>Disp:*50 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0* 4. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. Several low attenuation areas in the kidneys are too small to fully characterize. Temp 102.8. Discharge Medications: 1.Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). GRASP STRONG AND EQUAL, SLIGHTLY UNSTEADY GAIT, OOB TO CHAIR X2. AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval removal of the right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, and in it's place is a triple-lumen catheter with it'st tip in the mid SVC. Radiographic findings do not explain hypoxia. Addendum: NIFF, mechanics &amp; breathing trial on 7/0 in AM  There was no signs of aspiration. Moving all extremities CIWA scale negative. On the resting images there is partial reversibility of the apical defect, no reversibility of anterior wall defect and reversibility of the inferior wall defect. NO STOOL. The line was then aspirated, flushed, capped, and heplocked. ABGs WNL. C-collar intact, c-spine precautions maintained. Mild gallbladder wall thickening likely secondary to third spacing given the significant ascites and cirrhosis. Plan: Continue to monitor. No prior MRIs are available at this institution. </TEXT>
