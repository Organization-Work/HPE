Resp: O2 sats improved throughout the shift. 8am dose of lasix given at 530 am per pa for cp and resp distress. Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to determine whether the amount of peripheral enhancement has increased. Again seen is the 3.9 x 3.9 cm cystic structure in the left parietal resection bed (patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma).

L fem wound slowly healing, clean and dry. Neuro/Oncology: Exam improved markedly over 48 hrs and now has minimal comprehension and word finding difficulties. GOAL RATE FOR TUBE FEEDS AT 40CC/HR- WILL RESUME AT 1700. Blood soaked gauze packing removed. Outpatient Speech/Swallowing Therapy Speech Therapy - evaluation and treatment of aphasia 10. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o PNA, CHF, ILD CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: dye induced nephropathy   Retained barium is present throughout the colon from the prior video oropharyngogram. IV therapy failed. Note that the outside CT scan images were reviewed by the resident only, prior to the interpretation of this study, as they have not been digitized and made available on PACS. Several low attenuation areas in the kidneys are too small to fully characterize. </TEXT>
