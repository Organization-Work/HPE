      <TEXT>The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. GU/GI: NPO, ABD FIRM AND DISTENDED, BS HYPOACTIVE. With chin tuck positioning, there was no laryngeal penetration. No evidence of pneumonia. Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to see whether there has been any significant progression. PLAN: Monitor per protocol. Plan: Monitor hemodynamics. GU- pt w/ clear brisk u/o. There is again evidence of slight left ventricular enlargement of the heart. Pulses in feet obtained by doppler good DP, venous swish heard for PT and difficult to find. No ectopy. </TEXT>
