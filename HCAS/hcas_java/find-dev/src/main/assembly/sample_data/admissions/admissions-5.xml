      <TEXT>Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. Distal pulses + by doppler. There is no evidence of congestive heart failure. admitted to ccu for observation. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. There is no significant adjacent T2 signal abnormality that is not attributable to the hemorrhage. Coronal reformations were also obtained and reviewed. SW will alert Sat on site SW of pts condition and encourage staff to pg on call SW as needed. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the brain with multiplanar post-gadolinium T1 imaging. </TEXT>
