DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Atorvastatin 20 mg q.d., Senna tabs one b.i.d.prn,  copd-home o2 2l. htn. Creatine improved after hydration. A precarinal lymph node measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter is noted, a nonspecific finding. There is left retrocardiac density which could represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Then settled at 109. The osseous structures show degenerative change of the spine. </TEXT>
