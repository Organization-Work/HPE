Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: MRI/MRA repeat MRI/MRA Femoral line. Neuro: A&amp;O x3, MAE's, L weaker than R, following commands consistently, cooperative with care; moaning &amp; screaming with needs @ times;  IMPRESSION: 1. Hyperdense material present within the surgical bed is consistent with acute blood products, at site of resected astrocytoma. Cardiac: Pt c/o CP at 4pm which woke him up (earlier, he had CP on deep inspiration). PT WITH OCCASIONAL PROD COUGH. He was found to have a sodium of 106. On the resting images there is partial reversibility of the apical defect, no reversibility of anterior wall defect and reversibility of the inferior wall defect. Urine cx grew ampicillin sensitive enterococcus. Neuro: Rec'd patient agitated, unresponsive to orientation questions. PULM: ON CMV MODE, FIO2 0.4, RATE 20, VT DECREASED TO 400CC. Questionable allergy to ASA-GI bleed/red blotches? Will not treat w/ ASA per HO. Plan: monitor bood sugars, orient as needed, keep sitter at bedside, ? increase in lopressor dose, ? f2 later today if pt remains stable. </TEXT>
