      <TEXT>IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with the tip terminating in the SVC. PERRL. PROPOFOL STOPPED FOR ONE HOUR DUE TO LOW BP-&gt;  PLAN: PULMONARY TOILETING. See Carevu flowsheet for specifics. He was transferred to the CICU for continued monitoring and care. Lasix 80mg IVP given at 1045 w/ 400cc u/o over 3 hrs. There was no obvious weakness or other concerning symptoms. No prior MRIs are available at this institution. Periventricular white matter hypodensity is present and is notably greater on the left than the right, likely representing persistent peritumoral edema. NBP 98-118/55-73. 5 RESP: EXTUBATED @ 0900 WITHOUT INCIDENT. no insulin required at present. Coags sent and pending. gu; passing adequate amounts of clear yellow urine 30-50 mls/hr. via foley. cva x2 w sl r sided residual weakness-shunt/patch l carotid to ascending aorta A/P: S/P LAD stent x 4 c/b dissection. GU:U/O 30-50 cc/hr. Chest examination showed poor air movement bilaterally, but equal. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>GI: OGT DC'D WITH EXTUBATION. No free air or lymphadenopathy are seen in the abdomen. no flatus. Otherwise afebrile. At one point, he was incontinent of urine and stool. ENDO: INSULIN GTT PRESENTLY @ 1.5 UNITS FOR GLUCOSE 97. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: picc line placement. No rales. OXYGENATION &gt;97% ON 1LNC. Abdominal US revealed diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. 150CC'S OUT THIS AM. No additional areas of abnormal enhancement are identified. Urine tapered to 4cc/hr. Weaned off after po lopressor dose given. RR reg/unlabored. Studies: Head CT on admission:  PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. ABG acceptable, RSBI 78 this am. </TEXT>

The patient was immediately taken to scan, where his CT scan of the head confirmed what was seen on clinical exam that the patient had evidence of a massive intracranial hemorrhage. IMPRESSION: Status post catheter device placement within the left parietal cystic structure. Urine cx grew ampicillin sensitive enterococcus. IMPRESSION: Status post catheter device placement within the left parietal cystic structure. IMPRESSION: 1. Hyperdense material present within the surgical bed is consistent with acute blood products, at site of resected astrocytoma. CV: HR 80-100s SR/ ST rare pac, rare pvc. Diffusion-weighted imaging was also obtained. There was no acute bleeding and the source of bleeding was not identified.

NEURO: LETHARGIC, ORIENTED X2, FOLLOWING COMMANDS. The right brachial vein was then accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. The needle was then exchanged for an introducer sheath. w/ current plan of care. CV- BP as above, HR sinus, Hct slightly lower at 24.9 from 28.8. A final chest radiograph confirmed placement of the tip of the catheter to be in the superior vena cava. Repeat HCT 25 and INR unchanged at 1.4. PT DIURESING ADEQ AMTS CLEAR YELLOW URINE. HCT down to 21, pt transfused with 8ux additional units of PRBC's,infused via level 1 fluid warmer. </TEXT>
