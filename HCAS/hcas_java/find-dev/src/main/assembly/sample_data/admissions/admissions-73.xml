      <TEXT>As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. FINDINGS: Lung excursion has improved and no focal consolidation is evident. RR HIGH TEENS. No definite pleural effusions are identified but there may be some posteriorly layering of effusion, particularly on the right side. Possible posterior layering effusion on the right side. There is periventricular white matter digitiform hypodensity, significantly worse on the left, suggestive of persistent tumor-related. Urine spec sent. Pt having small amounts of thick sputum and occasional plugs and copious oral secretions. BP improved after off propofol, tolerating IV lopressor; weak palpable pulses x4;  </TEXT>

Sats 99% on 2L NC. IVF infusing at 125cc/h until 2110, all infusion stopped, CVP stopped. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with the tip terminating in the SVC. His hematocrit remained stable at 31.3, BUN 73, creatinine 3.1. There is magnetic susceptibility from the blood products as well as the clips in the craniotomy site, which obscures some of the image. GI: pt able to swollow crushed pills with applesause without problems. PATIENT IS WAITTING FOR PARACENTASIS IN AM. PERRL 4mm brisk; calm &amp; cooperative; off propofol CV: Afebrile; SR 70's-low 100's with rare PVC's;  He has history of PE and DVT post-op and will need to resume anticoagulation (lovenox) in 4-6 weeks.
