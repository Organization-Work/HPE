Susceptibility artifact is identified within the medial aspect of the left knee, presumably from a prior graft, however, no graft flow is identified, and thus it is presumably occluded. episode passed, HO aware. There has been interval placement of a right-sided IJ central venous line with its distal tip located within the upper right atrium. Brain perfusion study done in nuclear med which showed flow to R hemisphere. Check position of new right IJ central line. Unilateral Severe RAS: Pt has chronic kidney disease.
