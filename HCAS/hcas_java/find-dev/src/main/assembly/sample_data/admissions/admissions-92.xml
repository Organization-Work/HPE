FINDINGS: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable. also sputum induction done with usn/hypertonic saline. VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: There is normal oral bolus control. He has history of PE and DVT post-op and will need to resume anticoagulation (lovenox) in 4-6 weeks. She intermittently c/o difficulty breathing but Spo2 have been in high 90's t/o the night and RR remained ~ 20 BPM. CALM,PLEASANT,COOPERATIVE WITH CARE. MAE. PT transported to and from Ct scan without any incident. There is magnetic susceptibility from the blood products as well as the clips in the craniotomy site, which obscures some of the image. Vascular calcifications are seen in the aorta, IVC, splenic and renal arteries. GU; Foley to gravity with low urine output. Remain sedated on vent overnight. CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is unremarkable with a Foley catheter in place. O2 sats labile. CCU Nursing Progress Note S: " The pain is all gone"  </TEXT>

Retained barium is present throughout the colon from the prior video oropharyngogram. see above concerning cp , pt given tylenol with good effect for other c/o discomfort resp ls diminished thru out with increased breaths sounds and crackles following tx's. At the OSH, the pt was noted to be "unable to follow commands" and appeared confused. An indisputable new finding is now blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus clearly indicating that the pleural effusion on the left side must have increased. sats 98 on RA, pt pulled nc off.
