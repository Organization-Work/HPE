BS dim treated with nebs by RN with fair aeration noted. Pt taken to OR that day and had an I%D of left groin Vac dsg applied. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o CHF  FINAL REPORT HISTORY: Anterior MI, rule out CHF. Limited pulse doppler and color flow examination demonstrates hepatofugal flow in the main and right anterior portal veins. Pt positive 2 1/2 Liters for LOS despite attempt to diurese gently d/t CRI. Goal to keep SBP &lt; 140 and nipride titrated accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was in stable condition. No issues while here. RECEIVED 1U PRBCS FOR HCT 27. Vascular surgery was consulted for further treatment. The needle was then exchanged for an introducer sheath. though the left superficial femoral artery is patent throughout its mid and distal course, then occludes at the level of the popliteal artery. 1000 ABG: 7.34,47,127,26,0,98,99%.

      <TEXT>ABSENT CORNEALS. Hypoactive/Absent BS. The line was then secured to the skin with a StatLock device and a sterile transparent dressing applied. 6U PRBC ON HOLD FOR OR. There is patchy perihilar increased density bilaterally. Respiratory Care Pt received on A/C switched to CPAP/PSV 15/5 as documented. The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. No new hemorrhage is present. Continue to monitor. A precarinal lymph node measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter is noted, a nonspecific finding. Carolanne called x2. Nodular hepatic contour is consistent with underlying cirrhosis. </TEXT>
