      <TEXT>There are some subtle areas of increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, which could be due to small vessel disease or post therapy. COMPARISONS: None. Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis. Imaging of the organs of the upper abdomen is limited without intravenous contrast. Patient was transported to OSH where he was intubated for airway protection and his oropharynx and nose was packed. PT DIURESING ~ 50CC/HRLY, PT ~ +50OCC SINCE MN. Stereotactic biopsy of the lesion was performed and demonstrated grade III-IV anaplastic astrocytoma. He cannot repeat nor name, read, or write. Again seen is the 3.9 x 3.9 cm cystic structure in the left parietal resection bed (patient has a history of anaplastic astrocytoma). Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally. ABG improved with airway. 7.36/41/169 on 40%. Recently d/c from OSH for pna. Please refer to flow sheet for objective data. Falling asleep while on phone with relatives. No definite pleural effusions are identified but there may be some posteriorly layering of effusion, particularly on the right side. no residuals. There is a small amount of air within the fluid collection. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. There is no pulmonary edema or any focal abnormality elsewhere in the lungs. GU: PT VOIDING QS AMBER COLORED URINE. NPH and regular insulin b.i.d., Norvasc 5 mg q.d. The patient was placed supine on the angiography table. Pt also just finished blood transfusion. No enhancing nodules are identified. Diffusion-weighted imaging was also obtained. H/H stable. No evidence of pneumothorax. At the OSH, he was given 2 units of FFP, 10mg of vitamin K, and was loaded with 1g of fosphenytoin. OCC-STRONG NON-PRODUCTIVE COUGH. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: preop CT p frame placed for brain bx No contraindications for IV contrast  FINAL REPORT INDICATION: Pre-op for stereotactic brain aspiration. BP=88-105/40-50's.

      <TEXT>NO temp noted. Moderate left white matter edema has increased slightly compared to the preoperative exam. The line was then secured to the skin with a StatLock device and a sterile transparent dressing applied. This is bright on the pre-gadolinium images and demonstrates only mild marginal enhancement. heparin gtt started today. Rectal would not register. Resp: LS clear diminished. </TEXT>
