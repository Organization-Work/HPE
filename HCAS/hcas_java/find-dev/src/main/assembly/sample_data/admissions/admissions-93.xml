      <TEXT>Labs: Repeat K at 3pm = 5.4 (down from 5.9 after kexylate), Ca=7.7 (no repletion ordered) and  Ventricles and sulci are stable in size. There is no significant adjacent T2 signal abnormality that is not attributable to the hemorrhage. ABG RESULTS: 1000: 7.36,50,73,29,94,97%. No additional areas of abnormal enhancement are identified. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>stable hemodynamics. No major vascular territorial infarct. CR 3.7.K+5.3. Nodular hepatic contour indicates significant underlying significant fibrosis/cirrhosis. pt given NS bolus 500cc x 2 through night with improvement each time. The line was then secured to the skin with a StatLock device and a sterile transparent dressing applied. GOOD URINE OUTS NO ISSUES PLAN: WILL FOLLOW SERIAL HCTS AND TREAT AS NEEDED, MONITOR HEMODYNAMICS AND KEEP INTUBATED AND SEDATED. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY 1. Open lung biopsy was a lung transplant. When this was done is not documented. There is some ill-defined loss of translucency in the right mid- and lower zones and atelectatic changes are demonstrated in the left lower lobe behind the heart. </TEXT>

There is a thin rim of marginal enhancement present, which could represent residual or recurrent tumor. ?Need for additional dose of Kaexylate. MONIOTR VS, LABS, RESP STATUS, NEURO STATUS. GI: abd soft, BS present, remains NPO. Lopressor doses held per team. Susceptibility artifact is identified within the medial aspect of the left knee, presumably from a prior graft, however, no graft flow is identified, and thus it is presumably occluded. Hyperdense material present within the surgical bed is consistent with acute blood products, at site of resected astrocytoma. </TEXT>
