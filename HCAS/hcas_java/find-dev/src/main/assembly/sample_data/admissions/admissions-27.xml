      <TEXT>SWAN DC'D CI&lt;2. DENIES SOB. MRI scheduled. Nods "no" to ?pain. There is a slight increased size to the left ventricular cavity on both the stress and resting images. HEMATOMA FEELS MORE FIRM ON R SIDE OF ABD. Some associated upper zone redistribution is present but this is difficult to evaluate since the patient is supine. Mild gallbladder wall thickening likely secondary to third spacing given the significant ascites and cirrhosis. UNABLE TO PLACE PERIPHERAL ACCESS THEREFORE CENTRAL ACCESS LEFT IN PLACE. ABD SOFT, BM X2 (SOFT, BROWN STOOL), TUBE FEEDS AT 40CC/HR AND NO RESIDUALS, FOLEY DRAINING CLEAR, YELLOW URINE. </TEXT>

No free air or lymphadenopathy are seen in the abdomen. Social History: Not married. No children. Not working; used to be a welder.  though the left superficial femoral artery is patent throughout its mid and distal course, then occludes at the level of the popliteal artery. There is left retrocardiac density which could represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, small bowel, and colon are unremarkable. There is also dependent atelectasis running along the major fissures bilaterally and in the lung adjacent to the effusions. Follow labs. Lungs clear, but very decreased in bases - ? crackles. Slight left sided facial droop, neuro consulted pt today. no breakdown noted on back side. If detailed arterial anatomical information within the feet is required, dedicated MR angiogram of the feet could be performed. Increased generalized edema, L arm +2 edema. No prior MRIs are available at this institution. Local anesthesia was achieved with subcutaneous injection of 2 cc of 1% lidocaine. C/O chest heaviness which resolved spontaneously.
