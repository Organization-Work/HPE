      <TEXT>CV: nsr with bbb 70-80's. Per history, pt has been a daily drinker since the age of 14. transient labile bp, but maps remain &gt;60. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PAC TO TLC IN RIJ  FINAL REPORT HISTORY: 58 year old man with retrocardiac pneumonia. Pan cultured yesterday. Resp- pt vent settings unchanged, suctioned for thick tan secretions, Pt satting at 96-100%. There is stable cardiomegaly. Patient was transported to OSH where he was intubated for airway protection and his oropharynx and nose was packed. After the inner cannula was removed, the PICC was then advanced over the wire through the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. see above labs: 5.1 K+, 41=bun creat 1 id: afebrile. PTCA and stent x4 to LAD, (80% mRCA not intervened at this time) c/b dissection in distal LAD. ABG improved with airway. 7.36/41/169 on 40%. VOIDING CLEAR YELLOW URINE. ALSO ELEVATED GLUCOSE. Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 9. No evidence of pneumothorax. Endo- insulin gtt titrated to keep sugar between 100-120, BS slightly labile from 60-170, please see flow sheet for pattern. After the inner cannula was removed, the PICC was then advanced over the wire through the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. </TEXT>

FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a catheter into the left cystic structure in the resection bed (patient with history of anaplastic astrocytoma status post resection). ? free h2o secondary to increased Na and osmo. Endo: BS 105-180s. Collapse of left upper lobe as well as patchy atelectasis in left lower lobe, which may be due to the malpositioned tube. </TEXT>
