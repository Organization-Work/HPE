      <TEXT>ID: Afebrile overnight. There is left retrocardiac density which could represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Denies leg, or calf cramping or pain. o:neuro=initially a/a/o-after fentanly 12.5mcg-very confused/agitated/ @ x's combative. Low O2 saturation. IMPRESSION: Status post catheter device placement within the left parietal cystic structure. GU/GI: Foley draining good amounts of clear yellow urine. ABGs WNL. No movement to extremities. OOB to chair most of day, slow steady gait w/ assistance. The left hemithorax is slightly more opacified in comparison to the right one most probably due to layering small amount of pleural effusion. Otherwise there is no evidence of obstruction. Ph has improved from 7.21 to 7.28. Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. Neuro: Pt sedated on propofol and fentanyl. Radiographic findings do not explain hypoxia. Has been evaluated by her surgeon who plans to operate following cardiovascular work up. There is atelectasis within the basal portion of the left lower lobe which causes obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. </TEXT>
