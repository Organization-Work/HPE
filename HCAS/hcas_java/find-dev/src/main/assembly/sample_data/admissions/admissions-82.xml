A/p- ? team to talk w/ family, may approach CMO status as prognosis con't poor. though the left superficial femoral artery is patent throughout its mid and distal course, then occludes at the level of the popliteal artery. No prior MRIs are available at this institution. A slow ooze was visualized from the right tonsillar fossa which was cauterized. GI/GU- OGT in place. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. This is bright on the pre-gadolinium images and demonstrates only mild marginal enhancement. </TEXT>
