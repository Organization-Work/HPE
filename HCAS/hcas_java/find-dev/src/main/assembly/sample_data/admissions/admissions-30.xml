      <TEXT>IV therapy failed. IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process with improved aeration over preoperative radiograph. There is increased density at the left lung base with loss of the left hemidiaphragm contour. There is magnetic susceptibility from the blood products as well as the clips in the craniotomy site, which obscures some of the image. No diagnostic abnormalities. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: picc line placement. c/o "can't breathe", repeating "help me". There are no new areas of hemorrhage or infarct. IMPRESSION: Laryngeal penetration to the level of the vocal cords with rapid gulps of thin barium. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please perform MRI with gadolinium and MRA to evaluate left temporal lesion. A final chest radiograph confirmed placement of the tip of the catheter to be in the superior vena cava. NPN M/SICU ICU day 2 (1900 - 0700) Events: Recieved 500cc NS bolus for low U/O w/ good response. onychomycotic changes to nails -skin in b/l feet moderately cool L&gt;R, skin atrophic, hairless  Incont large amount of amber urine with bloody sediment at 1300. tan fluid, no BM. There was no signs of aspiration. PLACED BACK ON RATE TO REST RESOLVED. Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs is limited by the absence of IV contrast. </TEXT>
