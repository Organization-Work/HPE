An enhancing nodule is seen at the medial periphery of the lesion, and there is slight nodularity to the enhancing rim, both findings suggestive of tumor recurrence. The patient was extubated on postoperative day two. Pt intubated and CTscan showed frontal-parietal bleed and SDH with midline shift and numerous facial, sinus and skull fxs. Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to see whether there has been any significant progression. IV therapy failed. Also unchanged is slight thickening and enhancement to the posterior margin of this cystic region and small nodule off the superior margin, both concerning for tumor recurrence. It is unclear whether this large fluid collection actually communicates with retroperitoneal fluid described above. Desats to low 80s if mask remains off too long. PULSES WEAK PALPABLE. </TEXT>
