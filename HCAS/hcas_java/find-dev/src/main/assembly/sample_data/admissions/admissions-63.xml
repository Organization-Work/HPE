      <TEXT>Some sludge is noted within a mildly distended gallbladder. No c/o pain. Nodular hepatic contour is consistent with underlying cirrhosis. No ectopy. Abd firm/NT/ND. Foley in place w/ uo &gt; 30 cc/hr. No history of illicit drug use. Questionable allergy to ASA-GI bleed/red blotches? Will not treat w/ ASA per HO. A 0.018 guide wire was then advanced through the needle and into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. </TEXT>

MOVING ALL EXTREMITIES, NO NEURO DEFICITS NOTED @ THIS TIME. Endocrine: requiring RISS coverage for hyperglycemia. RESP: CPT X1. The patient was immediately taken to scan, where his CT scan of the head confirmed what was seen on clinical exam that the patient had evidence of a massive intracranial hemorrhage. (correction from above note that face tent has been at 100% all day). CPK peaked and trending downward. Pelvic loops of bowel are displaced posteriorly and superior by this large fluid collection. Pain: pt complain of alot of back and Left hip pain. Incont large amount of amber urine with bloody sediment at 1300. BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARTERIAL LINE AND BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF-&gt; ARTERIAL PRESSURE APPROXIMATELY 20-30 POINTS HIGHER THAN CUFF PRESSURE. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. There is no significant intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Endo: No coverage needed to present time. ABD TAUT, DISTENDED WITH REBOUND TENDERNESS ON RLQ. </TEXT>

Head CT non contrast  HOSPITAL COURSE: The Liver Service was consulted, because the patient has undergone a liver transplant six years ago for alcohol induced cirrhosis. There is a thin rim of marginal enhancement present, which could represent residual or recurrent tumor. started on colace. There is a small fluid collection measuring 3.8 x 2.8 cm within the right rectus abdominis muscle. Family History: no liver disease, no alcoholism. No DM. The LAD was unable to be stented. Last examine pt had no cough with sxing and only slight movement of BLEs to pain. Access: RUA 20 G flushes but does not draw, RtW 20 G d/c s/p infiltration.
