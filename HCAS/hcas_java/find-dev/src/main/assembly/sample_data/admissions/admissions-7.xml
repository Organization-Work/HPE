No additional areas of abnormal enhancement are identified. bp 103/54-160/50 . talked to wife on phone. unable to lift &amp; hold extremities at this time. BS dim treated with nebs by RN with fair aeration noted. GOOD URINE OUTS NO ISSUES PLAN: WILL FOLLOW SERIAL HCTS AND TREAT AS NEEDED, MONITOR HEMODYNAMICS AND KEEP INTUBATED AND SEDATED. Head CT non contrast  Received 230ml of contrast in cath lab. TLC over wire - CXRAY done - line placement in right area per HO - OK to use. Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to see whether there has been any significant progression. Serun sodium, osmo and chloride elevated over night , mannitol held and NS infusin cut back KVO. The peel-away sheath and wire were then removed. Chest examination showed poor air movement bilaterally, but equal. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>GU: condom foley intact, urine clear yellow. Resp Care Pt intermittintly wearing bipap t/o shift for hypercarbic resp failure and remains on NIPPV since 3pm. There are some subtle areas of increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, which could be due to small vessel disease or post therapy. Note that the outside CT scan images were reviewed by the resident only, prior to the interpretation of this study, as they have not been digitized and made available on PACS. CONTINUES ON 100% HUMIDIFIED HALF MASK-POX- &gt;95%. Now with diffuse intense abdominal pain and palpable pelvic mass while on IV heparin. no wheezing. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. UNABLE TO PLACE PERIPHERAL ACCESS THEREFORE CENTRAL ACCESS LEFT IN PLACE. The right brachial vein was then accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. </TEXT>
