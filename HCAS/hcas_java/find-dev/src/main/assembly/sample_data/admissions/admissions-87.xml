Has been evaluated by her surgeon who plans to operate following cardiovascular work up. 8, Hr 70-80's NSR with no ectopy, SBP 120-140. Pulmonary parenchymal consolidation is present within the dependent portion of both lung bases suggestive of aspiration. ALSO ELEVATED GLUCOSE. RLQ INCISION DSD PALP PULSES R: STABLE IMPROVING PULMONARY STATUS P: WEAN OFF PROPOFOL. Update O: cv status: sr w rare pvc. PT still requiring some boluses of fentanyl for breakthrough pain. Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to see whether there has been any significant progression. Qulatity of pain is not burning, numbness, or tingling On detailed review of symtpoms, she mentions an episode of SSCP lasting several minutes, releived with Sl NTG. on standing dose NPH BID. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without IV or oral contrast. There is no evidence of focal infiltrate. Also unchanged is slight thickening and enhancement to the posterior margin of this cystic region and small nodule off the superior margin, both concerning for tumor recurrence. Pt reated CP "8" out of 10. gi; refusing to take food and drink initially persuaded to take oj eventually at 830. SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The ET tube enters the right main stem bronchus. FINDINGS: Stereotactic cranial device is in place. Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2* 5. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>MRA TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight MRA of the head. This should be followed up as an out patient. Improved heart failure. Absent to very faint, hypoactive, distant bowel sound. The heart size is normal. Belongings given to fire chief in ER, family aware. IMPRESSION: Large fluid collection in the space of Retzius, with fluid-fluid level is indicative of a hematoma. IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral consolidations, right greater than left consistent with pneumonia. RESP: c/o x 1 of chest discomfort with respirations, shallow breathing, and pt desatted to 83-84% on NRB. No BM this shift. Lungs clear to dim at bases. TUBE FEEDS AT 40CC/HR STOPPED AT 1500 FOR BIPAP.

No deficits in strenght, coordination, sensation or gait. c/o difficulty breathing 2 pm. IMPRESSION: 1) Pulmonary parenchymal consolidation within the dependent portions of both lung bases consistent with mild degree of aspiration. Flap area tense, Pt's bp gradually rising despite increased dose of PO lopresser requiring one PRN bolus of lopressor 10mg IV. There was no obvious weakness or other concerning symptoms. pm continue with pulmonary toilet follow up on ct scan results. (correction from above note that face tent has been at 100% all day). IMPRESSION: A left temporal lobe subacute hematoma. MRI with gadolinium revealed 2x4cm enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe. Turns w/ min assists. Small rectus sheeth hematoma.

ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: A focal opacity at the posterior left lung base could represent scarring or atelectasis. Monitor resp. status. NPO d/t resp. status. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with the tip terminating in the SVC. BUN/Cr 55/2.8 (up from 44/2.4) BS=402 - pt on sliding scale and NPH 10 units BID added. Amlodipine 5 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). Patient presented to OSH 1 day ago. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. CV: BP labile. c/o difficulty breathing 2 pm. At ~4:20am, he was found by the nurse to be unresponsive. </TEXT>
