      <TEXT>After the inner cannula was removed, the PICC was then advanced over the wire through the sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. Cardiac: Pt c/o CP at 4pm which woke him up (earlier, he had CP on deep inspiration). Hct dropped, 2 ux of PRBC's were given, 2nd ux finished soon after arrival. RESP: INTUBATED FOR CONCERN OF REBLEED AND AIRWAY PROTECTION. ABDOMINAL US: 1.Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. There is no significant intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally. Retained barium is present throughout the colon from the prior video oropharyngogram. Retrocardiac density is still present, consistent with consolidation/atelectasis/effusion. S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted. </TEXT>
