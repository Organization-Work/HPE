CV: Hemodynamically stable. Labs sent at 18:00. There is a small amount of retroperitoneal fluid around Gerota's fascia. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. Also noted to have severe right RAS. Ventricles and sulci are stable in size. Plan: wean as tolerate and keep confortable. Will follow.

There is a thin rim of marginal enhancement present, which could represent residual or recurrent tumor. Feeds are via ogt. Lt pupil 3-4mm reactive. No free air or free fluid is present within the abdomen or pelvis. Pulmonary parenchymal consolidation is present within the dependent portion of both lung bases suggestive of aspiration. There is magnetic susceptibility from the blood products as well as the clips in the craniotomy site, which obscures some of the image. ALINE DC'D.
