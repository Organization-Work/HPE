      <TEXT>Weaned off NRB to humidified shovel mask 70% to 40% this afternoon w/ 4L N/C. PH 7.27, up from 7.17.

      <TEXT>GLUCOSE ELEVATED &gt;200 A: WEANING PROPOFOL &amp; VENT. Pulmonary was consulted, because of the CT and chest x-ray showing dependent consolidation with small bilateral pleural effusions and large ascus vein. Fan on in room. 1200: 7.35,50, 105, 29, 0, 97, 97%. Periventricular white matter hypodensity is present and is notably greater on the left than the right, likely representing persistent peritumoral edema. BP=88-105/40-50's. PT consult tomorrow, ECHO today or tomorrow, c/o to floor when stable. No additional areas of abnormal enhancement are identified. BUN/Cr on the rise - monitor u/o, labs. Monitor BS now that NPH has been added. No pneumothorax is identified. Continues on maint fluids despite addition of feeds. ID: Tmax 102.8 po, SICU HO aware. pulses dopperable. Limited pulse doppler and color flow examination demonstrates hepatofugal flow in the main and right anterior portal veins. FINAL REPORT INDICATION: Hypoxia. </TEXT>
