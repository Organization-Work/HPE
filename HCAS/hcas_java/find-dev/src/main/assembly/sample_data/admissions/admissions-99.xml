      <TEXT>ABG WNL. RESP; Clear lung sound bilaterally. Insulin Regular Human 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: as dir Injection ASDIR (AS DIRECTED): as dir. Lasix 80mg IVP given at 1045 w/ 400cc u/o over 3 hrs. As no suitable superficial veins were identified, ultrasound evaluation of the right upper extremity was performed which revealed the brachial vein to be patent and compressible. Once back in bed pt experiencing reoccuring episodes of increased O2 demand and CP. Pt required several doses of MS, Fentanyl, and fentanyl gtt started. Her left foot will ensuingly becomes numb and painful. RR 20-31. AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been interval extubation. Still minor paraphasic errors, but much improved. NS bolus 500cc infused and NS at 125cc/hr x2 liters infusing at this time. Prior social use of alcohol, but none recently. A catheter device has been introduced and there is a moderate amount of air within the collection. There is patchy perihilar increased density bilaterally. Pt repositioned frequently and hot pack applied. acidosis on cpap. </TEXT>

      <TEXT>The patient's INR was elevated to 5 at outside hospital. Very supportive. RSBI=40 this am. tolerating IV lopressor; dopplerable pulses x4, L groin wound wet-dry dressing changed, wound base pink  BP improved after off propofol, tolerating IV lopressor; weak palpable pulses x4;  AM BUN/CR^ 44/2.5. FINAL REPORT PICC LINE PLACEMENT INDICATION: Left temporal astrocytoma, hemorrhage, bradycardia, need for IV therapy, failed bedside attempt. RECEIVED ON PEEP 0, PRESSURE 7-&gt; PT. foley cath flushed w slight imrprvment in uop. Diabetic on insulin. The patient was able to swallow a barium pill, which briefly hung up in the valleculae. Pt required several doses of MS, Fentanyl, and fentanyl gtt started. O2 sats 97-100%. Resp: Rec'd patient in face mask O2, ABG 7.10/70, placed back on BiPAP. Hypoactive/Absent BS.

      <TEXT>O: See careview for additional objective data. A limited renal ultrasound was performed at bedside. PT DIURESING ADEQ AMTS CLEAR YELLOW URINE. Plan: Extubate after cuff leak confirmed. Please assess ETT placement. Pt positive 2 1/2 Liters for LOS despite attempt to diurese gently d/t CRI. Received pt on bipap. There is no abnormal signal deep to the region of enhancement. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o PNA, CHF, ILD CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: dye induced nephropathy   R angio site clean/intact w/ tegaderm dressing, no oozing or hematoma noted. There is a rougly 3 cm collection of hyperattenuating material (53 - 57HU) at the dorsal aspect of the cystic cavity, consistent with acute blood products. PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. mae to commands. There is a slight decrease in laryngeal elevation and delayed closure of the vestibule. </TEXT>
