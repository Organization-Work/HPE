CV: Both lower extremities were mottled now this am has minimal mottling. Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250-50 mcg/Dose Disk with Device Sig: One (1) Disk with Device Inhalation BID (2 times a day). give methadone when available, bedrest until 1600. There is no significant adjacent T2 signal abnormality that is not attributable to the hemorrhage. No changes. No seizure activity. This was complicated by a rectus sheath hematoma. talked to wife on phone. </TEXT>

Discharge Medications: 1.Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg/5 mL Solution Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain.   Gag present Endo: blood sugars well controlled. Radiographic findings do not explain hypoxia. pleasant and cooperative. Conts. protonix for GI prophylaxis. Lopressor to be ^ to 75mg/bid today. BS remain coarse, diminished in bases. Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. 20 OF LASIX IV, GOOD DIURESIS. VS now stable s/p intubation. Pt made DNR.
