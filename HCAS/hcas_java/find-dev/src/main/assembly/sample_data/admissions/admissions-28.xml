Pt was awaiting transfer to rehab when she became lethargic and hypotensive in the afternoon. 1200: 7.35,50, 105, 29, 0, 97, 97%. Bilateral consolidations are noted, predominantly in the superior aspect of the right lower lobe where multiple air bronchograms are seen. Susceptibility artifact is identified within the medial aspect of the left knee, presumably from a prior graft, however, no graft flow is identified, and thus it is presumably occluded. Tmax 99.3. There is no shift of normally midline structures. 7a-7p Neuro: Received pt lethargic, easily arousable. ALLERGIES: Talwin and Codeine, manifestations unknown.
