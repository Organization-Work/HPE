Comparison would need to be obtained with the outside MRI to determine whether the amount of peripheral enhancement has increased. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and were essential for diagnosis. Abdominis rectus hematoma status post abdominal exploration, resolved. Right groin site intact. Mostly anxious about having cpap mask on. Based upon the markers on the guide wire, the PICC catheter was then trimmed to a length of 40 cm. PT ANSWERING ALL QUESTIONS APPROPRIATELY.

      <TEXT>The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. LUNG SOUNDS CLEAR BUT SLIGHTLY DIMINISHED AT BASES. Neuro: Pt sedated, presently on propofol 100cmg/kg/min and fentanyl 100mcg/hr. Resolves without additional intervention. There has been interval development of collapse of the left upper lobe. Inconsistently follows commands. RESP: LS CLEAR THROUGHOUT. c/o pain last eve and medicated with tylenol 650 via ogt with good effect. +gag, + cough. The patient was followed by the Social Service for multiple social issues. IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is a relatively mild region of right infrahilar consolidation which could be atelectasis. There have been no other changes in the two-day interval. ?COPD d/t extensive hx pf tobacco use. EXTENDS LEGS WITH NIPPLE PINCH. </TEXT>
