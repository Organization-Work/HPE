Improving congestive heart failure. 2. Continuing left lower lobe pneumonia. Respirations 30. Skin: Bottom pink. He had stable vital signs and was alert and oriented complaining only of nausea after oral potassium replacement. General overall weakness but MAE. Also noted to have severe right RAS. Pt dozing intermittently overnight. The mediastinum is unremarkable. HR 78-87. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Will cont with bipap as needed. GI/GU: Abd soft. 7a-7p Neuro: Pt lightly sedated on propofol 5-10mcg/kg/min. Continue on CIWA scale 3. There is magnetic susceptibility from the blood products as well as the clips in the craniotomy site, which obscures some of the image. The patient's heparin was discontinued. </TEXT>

Had no associated N/V, diaph, SOB. Pt denies N/V but states ? tolerating sandwich. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with the tip terminating in the SVC. IV therapy failed. Local anesthesia was achieved with subcutaneous injection of 2 cc of 1% lidocaine. Since d/c, notes progressive cooling of left foot. Please assess ETT placement. Susceptibility artifact is identified within the medial aspect of the left knee, presumably from a prior graft, however, no graft flow is identified, and thus it is presumably occluded. </TEXT>
